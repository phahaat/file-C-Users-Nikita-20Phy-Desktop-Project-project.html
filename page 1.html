  <h4>ADVANTAGES OF CLASSIFFICATION</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>It facilitates the identification of organisms.</li>
    <li>It explains how different creatures interact with one anothe</li>
    <li>It aids in the comprehension of organism evolution.</li>
    <li>It helps to understand how animals, plants, and other living creatures are related and how they can benefit humans</li>
    <li>The features of entire groups can be learned by studying a few creatures.
    </li>
    <li>Organization: Classification helps us organize information into categories based on shared characteristics. This makes it easier to find, store, and retrieve information. For example, imagine a library without any classification system - finding a specific book would be a monumental task!</li>
    <li>Identification: Classification systems establish a common language for identifying things. This is essential in fields like biology, where organisms are classified based on their properties, making it easier to recognize and study them.

    </li>
    <li>Prediction: By studying classified groups of things, we can start to make predictions about individual members of that group.  For instance, knowing an animal is a mammal allows us to predict certain things about its biology, like that it likely nurses its young with milk.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Understanding relationships: Classification systems can reveal relationships between things.  In biological taxonomy, classification helps us understand how different organisms are related to each other through evolution.
