<h4 >DISSADVANTAGES OF CLASSIFICATION</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Oversimplification: The world is messy and complex. Classification systems can force things into categories that don't perfectly capture all their nuances. An animal might share traits with multiple categories, or a new discovery might not fit neatly into existing classifications.</li>
    <li>Loss of information: By focusing on what makes things similar for classification purposes, we might overlook important individual variations or exceptions.  A classification system for fruits might highlight color and texture, but it wouldn't capture the unique flavor of a particular variety.</li>
    <li>Bias:  Classification systems are designed by humans, and can reflect our own biases.  For example, early biological classifications often placed European humans at the top, reflecting a racist perspective.</li>
    <li>Limited adaptability:  The world is constantly changing, and classification systems can struggle to keep up.  New discoveries or evolving concepts might necessitate revising or even abandoning an existing classification system altogether.</li>
