<h1>CLASSIFFICATION</h1>
        <p>
            Classification is all about organizing things into groups based on similar characteristics.<br> It's a fundamental way that we understand the world around us. Here's a breakdown of the two main ways to think about classification:
            
           <br> <b> Act of Grouping:</b><br> This is the process of sorting things into categories. For example, you might classify your laundry into darks and lights, or classify your books by genre.
           <br> <b>The Groups Themselves:</b><br> These are the categories that things are sorted into. So, in the laundry example, "darks" and "lights" would be the classifications.
            Classification systems are all around us, from the scientific classification of organisms in biology to the Dewey Decimal System used in libraries. They help us make sense of information by finding relationships between things.
          </p>
          <h4>types of classifications</h4>
          <p>There are two main ways to classify things:

           <br><b> Artificial Classification:</b><br> This system groups things together based on easily observable characteristics, without considering evolutionary relationships.  For example, libraries might classify books by genre (fiction, non-fiction, mystery, etc.), or grocery stores might classify fruits by color (red, orange, yellow, etc.).
           <br><b>Natural Classification:</b><br> This system groups things together based on their evolutionary relationships.  In biology, for example, organisms are classified into a hierarchy of groups (domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary history.    
           <h4>Artififial classification</h4>
           <p>Artificial classification, in contrast to natural classification, groups things together based on easily observable characteristics, not considering evolutionary history. It's a simpler way to organize things, but it doesn't necessarily reflect how things are truly related.

            Here are some key features of artificial classification:<br>
            
           <b> Focuses on Observable Traits:</b><br> This system relies on characteristics that are easy to see or measure, like size, color, habitat, or function. For example, a library might classify books by size (hardcover, paperback) or by author's last name.
            Limited Scope: Since it doesn't consider evolutionary relationships, artificial classification can sometimes group together unrelated things, or separate closely related things.
            Useful for Specific Purposes: Despite its limitations, artificial classification can be very useful for specific tasks. For example, grocery stores might classify fruits by color (red, orange, yellow) to create a visually appealing display, even though fruits of different colors can be closely related.
            Here are some common examples of artificial classification:<br>
            
           <b> Libraries:</b><br> Books might be classified by genre (fiction, non-fiction), language, publication date, or author's last name.<br>
            <b>Grocery Stores:</b><br>  Items might be classified by department (produce, dairy, meat), color (red, orange, yellow), or brand.<br>
           <b> Clothing Stores: </b><br> Clothes might be classified by type (shirts, pants, dresses), size (small, medium, large), or gender (men's, women's).
            Artificial classification, while not reflecting evolutionary relationships,  remains a valuable tool for organizing and  accessing information in many everyday situations.
            
            <p>
                <h4>natural classification</h4>
                Natural classifications group together plants with many of the same characteristics and are highly predictive. That is, by enumerating the characteristics of a plant, one can predict the natural group to which it belongs. Taxonomic floras, for example, identify species, genera, and families by listing as many characteristics as possible concerning anatomy, morphology, cytology, ecology, biochemistry, genetics, and distribution.
            
            <h4>ways of classifing in natural classification</h4>
            <h5>Phylogenetic (phyletic) classifications</h5>
            Phyletic classifications are natural classifications that try to identify the evolutionary history of natural groups. When botanists accepted Darwin's theory of evolution near the end of the last century, the reasons why some groups of plants looked alike became clear: They were related to one another by a common ancestry. The mission of taxonomy since Darwin has become a quest for evolutionary relationships, not just at the lower levels of the hierarchy, but at the upper levels as well.
<br>
            The evolutionary history of a taxon is called its phylogeny. 
<h5>Numerical taxonomy (phenetics)</h5>
Systematists have tried many ways to make phyletic classifications more subjective. When computers became readily accessible in the 1960s, numerical taxonomy or phenetics became a popular approach. In practice, measurements were made of a large number of characters of a taxon, at least 60 per plant and often 100 or more. No special importance was attributed to any one of the characters. After the measurements were complete on hundreds of individuals, the data were analyzed statistically with computer programs and cluster analysis or other methods to show purported natural groupings of plants with overall similarities. Systematists' interpretations were thought to be minimized in this fashion.
 <h5>Cladistics classification</h5>
 Cladistics is the most popular method of classifying organisms today. In contrast to phenetics, in which similarities are sought using as many characters as possible, cladists look for patterns using derived character states (that is, features that have evolved from an ancestral character group). The intent is to find groups of organisms that share a common ancestor and to diagram the relationship of the groups, called clades, in a cladogram           
<h5>Molecular biology and phylogeny</h5>

The most promising developments in formulating a phylogeny for the entire tree of life come today from molecular biology, where new tools and techniques allow researchers to use as character states the molecular sequences of amino acids as well as those of nucleotides in nucleic acids. The latter is the most fundamental of comparisons for, of course, the genes control the structure of life itself. The closer the similarity in sequences of molecules among groups of organisms, the closer the relationship of the groups. Widely different sequences indicate a different evolutionary history and ancestry.
</p>
<br>
Some assumptions made by the users of molecular sequencing include:
<Ol>
    
    <li>Phenotypic (outward appearance) evolutionary changes accompanied by genetic (hereditary) changes occur over time in organisms.</li>
    <li>Long time intervals result in the accumulation of more changes.</li>
    <li>Organisms that have the most similarities in their gene sequences are more closely related than those with fewer; they have had a shorter time in which to evolve different phenotypes and genotypes.</li>
    <li>The groups with widely different sequences must have separated at an earlier time in the evolutionary past.</li>
</Ol>
<h3>kingdoms of classification</h3>
<p><b><u>Animalia</u><b><br> Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that obtain nutrients by heterotrophy, meaning they eat other organisms. They are mobile and have complex organ systems.</p>
<p><b><u>Plantae</u></b><br> Plants are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that obtain nutrients by autotrophy, meaning they make their own food through photosynthesis. They have cell walls made of cellulose and are typically immobile.</p>
<p><b><u>Fungi</u></b><br> are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that obtain nutrients by decomposition or parasitism. They have cell walls made of chitin and are typically immobile.</p>
<p><b><u>Protista</u></b><br> Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that do not fit neatly into any of the other kingdoms. They can be unicellular or multicellular, autotrophic or heterotrophic, mobile or immobile.</p>
<p><b><u>Archaea</u></b><br> Archaea are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that live in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt marshes. They have a different cell wall structure than bacteria and are thought to be one of the earliest forms of life on Earth.</p>
<p><b><u>Bacteria</u></b><br> are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that are found everywhere on Earth. They can be autotrophic or heterotrophic and can be beneficial or harmful.<a href="frame.html">link to frame</a><br>
