    <h4 >METHODS OF CLASSIFICATION</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Hierarchical Classification: This method arranges items into a series of categories, with more general categories at the top and more specific categories nested below them, like a branching tree.</li>
        <li>Top-Down Classification: This is a way to assign items to increasingly specific categories within a hierarchical system. For instance, classifying a document might start with it being non-fiction, then academic, then history, then a specific historical period.

        </li>
        <li>Bottom-Up Classification: This involves grouping similar items together and then finding broader categories that encompass those groups.  Imagine sorting a pile of clothes by color, then by type (shirts, pants, etc.)</li>
        <li>Statistical Classification: This method uses statistical techniques to classify items.  Machine learning algorithms are a type of statistical classification, where a computer program learns to classify items based on a set of training data.</li>
        <li>Manual Classification: This refers to human experts classifying items based on their knowledge and experience.  Librarians classifying books or art historians classifying paintings are examples of manual classification.</li>
